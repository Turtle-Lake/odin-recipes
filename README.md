a project based on https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes

Skills used: basic HTML, including `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>` usage, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` usage, and `<img>` with relative linking, and accompanying alt text.

I learned how to link to img with the `<img>` tag, including src and alt tags. 

I made use of both `<ul>` and `<ol>`, ul for ingredients and ol for steps.

This was a very useful way to get used to HTML, including making the HTML boilerplate from scratch and usage of subdirectory/parent directory relative linking when it came to the images.
